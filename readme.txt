README FILE FOR ATM SIMULATION

This ATM simulation was created by Chris Brannan.  It is my first object 
oriented JavaScript application.  Inspired by Andy Siprelle.


*** NOTES ***

Under the <body> tag, onload="startSimulation();" :

The ATM settings can be adjusted by injecting values as follows: 

	startSimulation(numberOfTwentys, numberOfTens, maxWithdrawal, serviceFee);
							
By default (omitted), these values are: 2500, 250, 400, 4

Adjust these values for different scenarios.



Console commmands:

The simulation object and ATM object are wrapped in a main object.

For example: To force-set the amount of tens or twentys in the ATM machine:

	main.atmMachine.numberOfTens = 25
	main.atmMachine.numberOfTwentys = 15
	
To see all the receipts that have been generated by the simulation:

	main.atmMachine.receipts
	
To run the simulation at different speeds the command: 

	main.sim.run(speed)
	
can be invoked. 1 is real time, 10 is the simulation default speed.
Run it over 100 at your own risk.


KNOWN ISSUES:

The simulation can be ran at different speeds however this needs to be 
developed further for accuracy.  As it is, when you run it at 100 as opposed 
to the normal 10 speed you will notice an increase in activity. 

Pauing the simulation can be invoked either by:

	main.sim.pause()
		or
	main.sim.run(0)
	
Pauing the simulation will freeze the canvas but the simulation will still 
continue to run in the background.  


AudioMan isn't functional yet.... it's a prototype for managing sound 
controls and simulation volume.  Further development needed.


Lastly:

There are a million ways to improve this project.  Here is a list of things I 
would focus on if I were to continue working on it:

	Introduce "projected" data to the plot graph.

	Make it scalable, so more than one ATM machine can be created and be scaled 
	and laid out properly.

	Create a dedicated screen or window on the ATM Machine for showing all the 
	collected stats on the ATM machine while the simulation continues to run in 
	the background.
	
	Create the interface for the audio manager.
	
	Experiment on mobile devices.
